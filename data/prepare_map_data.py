Regenerate with `python3 data/prepare_map_data.py` after updating `laureates-full.json`.
No geographic visual is published yet. The prepared records preserve the source's
birth-country values and award-affiliation strings, plus parsed locations.

- People: {len(records)}
- Birth countries with a code: {len(records) - len(missing_birth)}
- Missing or unrecognized birth country: {', '.join(missing_birth) or 'none'}
- People without an award-affiliation entry: {', '.join(missing_affiliations) or 'none'}
- Stanford University or its medical school at time of award: {len(stanford)} people ({', '.join(stanford)})
- Affiliation entries without a city-level place: {', '.join(unresolved_places) or 'none'}

John Martinis has a blank birth country in the source data. The output uses USA,
supported by [Nobel's 2025 physics background](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/12/popular-physicsprize2025-4.pdf),
which says he was born in Los Angeles. This override is explicit in the script;
the source file remains untouched.

Affiliation city parsing is a starting point for cartography. The `coordinates`
fields are deliberately null until each place is geocoded and checked. Entries
like Howard Hughes Medical Institute, USA and LIGO/VIRGO Collaboration do not
identify a single city and must remain unresolved. Birth-country geography
answers where laureates were born; affiliation geography answers where they
worked when awarded. These should be distinct map views.
